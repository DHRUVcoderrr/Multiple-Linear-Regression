# Multiple-Linear-Regression
This repository contains an implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using Python. MLR is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between a dependent variable and **two or more independent variables**.

---

## 📌 Features

* Implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using scikit-learn.
* Handles multiple independent variables.
* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization).
* Model evaluation using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * R² Score
* Data visualization for regression results.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-linear-regression.git
cd multiple-linear-regression
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python multiple_linear_regression.py
```

Or explore the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook MLR.ipynb
```

## 📊 Example Output

* Coefficients of independent variables
* Regression equation:

  $$
  Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ
  $$
* Performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)
* Residual plots to check model fit

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.8+**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
* **scikit-learn**


👉 Do you want me to also include **an example dataset (like housing prices or salaries)** in the README so that people can directly try it out?
